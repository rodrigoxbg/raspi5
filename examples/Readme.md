# Instructions

There are some examples using the raspi5 library. To compile one of them, you should only change the name of the folder. It will create the executable on the example folder and it could be executed with run.

```bash
    make TARGET=digital    <-- To compile the digital project
    make run               <-- To run the last project compiled
    make clean             <-- To delete the executable of the last project compiled
```

Is important to execute "clean" to give space to compile another project in case you want to Change the project.
